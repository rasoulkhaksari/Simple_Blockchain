# **Simple Blockchain and a cryptocurrency**

## **Issues:**
- Code the core blockchain
- Build an API around the blockchain
- Create a dynamic peer-to-peer server multiple contributors
- Implement a proof-of-word system to balance users
- Create a transaction system for cryptocurrency 


## **Blockchian**
The blockchain is a distributed and desentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its network .

## **Ledger**
A ledger is a record-keeping book that stores all the transactions of an organization. 

## **Why use the blockchain?**
- Decentralization leads to a trustless system. (no need to trust to a central manager)
- No middle men and no fees.
- Highly secure and no central point of failure
- Dependable data

## **Cryptocurrency**
- A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange
- It hast three main features:
  - **a secure blockchain:** use cryptography(public/privare key pair) to generate digital signitures
  - **wallets:** Objects that store the private and public keys of an individual. (public key is the address of wallet) 
  - **mining:**
    - Transactions are temporarily "unconfirmed"
    - Include blocks of transactions by solving a "proof of work" algorithm
      - Difficult to solve, and computationally expensive
      - Once solved, the miner can add the block and other miners will verify
      - Miners are rewarded for adding a block to the chain
      - The difficulty can adjust to control the rate of new blocks coming in
